## Education

### MSc in Artificial Intelligence

I studied my masters at the University of Edinburgh from September 2019 to August 2020.

My dissertation project was on how altering bias in word embeddings affects the fairness of hate speech classification of Spanish tweets. You can find the repo for the project [here](https://github.com/rimusa/embedding_bias), the project proposal [here](https://github.com/rimusa/embedding_bias/blob/master/documents/MSc_Dissertation.pdf), and the dissertation [here](https://github.com/rimusa/embedding_bias/blob/master/documents/MSc_Dissertation.pdf).

Some of the courses that I took include:

- Accelerated Natural Language Processing (ANLP)
- Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition (MLPR)
- Machine Learning Practical (MLP)
- Natural Language Understanding, Generation, and Machine Translation (NLU+)
- Computational Cognitive Neuroscience (CNN)
- Algorithmic Game Theory and Applications (AGTA)
- Informatics Project Proposal (IPP)
- Informatics Research Review (IRR)

Other projects I participated in were:

- A comparison of multimodal emotion recognition models using the [MELD dataset](https://affective-meld.github.io/). Some of the architectures we used included LSTMs and gated attention models.
- A survey of the current state (as of January, 2020) of computational linguistics regarding Ancient Egyptian. The paper for this project can be found [here](../documents/IRR_Final.pdf).

### BSc in Mathematics
