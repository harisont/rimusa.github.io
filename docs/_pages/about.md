Hi! I am Ricardo Muñoz Sánchez and I'm from Mexico City, Mexico.
I am currently doing a PhD in Natural Language Processing at the University of Gothenburg.
My project is on how the structure and flow of information within news articles can help identify fake news.

Other of my professional interests are bias and fairness in AI, hatespeech detection, and rumor mining.

I did an undergraduate degree in Mathematics at UNAM (in Mexico) and a masters degree in Artificial Intelligence at The University of Edinburgh.
